Special Containment Procedures:
ALY-1 is to be kept in a high-security 1x1 kilometer fenced area at all times. A minimum of 4 security personnel are to be stationed at Site ALY-1, where each group of 2 security personnel cover both entrances. Non-personnel encountering the site are to be interviewed and administered Class E amnestics. However, in the case that non-personnel encountering the site have not come in physical contact with ALY-1, they are to be administered normal Class F amnestics and released. In the case that said non-personnel do come in physical contact with ALY-1, normal procedures are to be followed, and a cover story is to be released regarding the whereabouts of said non-personnel. Personnel are to avoid physical contact with the anomaly unless given approval from the Overseer Council.

Description:
ALY-1 is a spiral-shaped gravel path with 2 entrances. Any person who attempts to walk one of these paths will walk uphill indefinitely, always leading to where they started. However, attempting to walk the opposite direction is non-anomalous, and will lead back to one of the 2 entrances respectively.
